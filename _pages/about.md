I'm Maya, a data scientist and researcher with a PhD in astrophysics and a passion for applying data science to environmental problems.

As a researcher at the University of Chicago, I led multiple research projects that focused on analyzing large data sets from a variety of telescopes, including my own collaboration's telescope, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. My research includes measuring signals in noisy maps of the sky using scipy, pandas, and JAX and comparing these measurements to physically motivated models. I have also developed machine learning models in JAX that allow us to simulate maps of our observable universe at specific frequencies. These projects involve analyzing complex, and often messy or incomplete, datasets and developing new approaches to address problems in my field. 

Since finishing my degree I have been working as an Applied Data Scientist at Civis Analytics. My role focuses on helping non-profit organizations develop build out data pipelines to allow for end to end analysis of their data. I work with leadership teams to define key KPIs, develop database solutions to help organize their data, implement ETL solutions to transform their raw data into useful insights and then build out visualizations in Tableau and streamlit to enable live reporting.

Before starting my PhD, I studied pastry at Le Cordon Bleu, and I still love to bake in my free time. I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing, although Chicago is admittedly a little on the flat side!
